# PCB Reactive Transport Model R Package

This package contains an implementation of the PCB reactive transport model, as described in [Bako et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c01043). The model is used to simulate the fate and transport of PCBs in a shaken bioreactor system, and can be used to investigate the effectiveness of various bioremediation strategies.

## Installation

You can install the package from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("username/PCB-Reactive-Transport-Model")
```

#Usage
To run the model, you first need to load the package:

```r
library(pcb.rtm.package)
```
